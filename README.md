Data Collection:
To compare the price fares, we need to collect data from both Ola and Uber platforms. This data should include ride details, such as distance traveled, time of the ride, and the corresponding fare charged for each ride.

Data Preprocessing:
Once the data is collected, we need to preprocess it to ensure consistency and remove any outliers or anomalies that might affect the comparison. Data preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, handling missing values, and dealing with any discrepancies in fare amounts.

Comparison Metrics:
To compare the price fares between Ola and Uber, we can use the following metrics:

Average Fare: Calculate the average fare for rides taken through both platforms.

Fare Distribution: Visualize the fare distribution of rides for each platform to identify any significant differences.

Fare Variation with Distance and Time: Analyze how the fare varies concerning the distance traveled and the time of the day for both Ola and Uber rides.

Data Analysis:
Perform a detailed analysis of the preprocessed data to draw insights into the fare pricing strategies of Ola and Uber. Look for patterns, trends, and variations in fares based on different factors, such as distance, time, and location.

Statistical Tests:
Conduct statistical tests to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the fare pricing between Ola and Uber. For instance, you could perform a hypothesis test to compare the means of the fare distributions.

Visualization:
Use various data visualization techniques to present the findings clearly. Create plots, histograms, and other visual representations to showcase the comparison between Ola and Uber fares effectively.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and comparison of price fares between Ola and Uber, draw meaningful conclusions about the pricing strategies of both companies. Identify any substantial variations in fares and provide insights into potential reasons for these differences.
