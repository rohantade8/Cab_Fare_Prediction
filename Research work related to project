**#Primary Research:**
Data Collection:
Gather data related to cab rides, including factors that affect fare like distance, time, location, etc. You might need to collect data from various sources or APIs of different cab service providers like Uber and Ola.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the collected data. Handle missing values, outliers, and format discrepancies. This step is crucial for accurate model training.

Feature Engineering:
Create relevant features from the collected data. For instance, you can extract day of the week, time of the day, and calculate distances between pickup and drop locations.

Model Selection:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for your prediction task. Regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting could be suitable for cab fare prediction.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the data into training and testing sets. Train your chosen models on the training set and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tune the parameters of your selected models to achieve the best performance. This might involve using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

Model Deployment:
Deploy the trained model to a suitable environment. This could be a cloud-based platform or a local server.

**#Secondary Research:**
API Availability:
Investigate the availability of APIs for various cab service providers like Uber and Ola. Mention that while you found an API for Uber, there might be challenges in obtaining an API for Ola, which might influence your choice of cab service providers for the project.

Geographical Considerations:
Discuss the differences in cab booking services between India and the USA. Mention that in the USA, services like Uber are more prevalent and might provide better access to APIs for your project. This could lead to more accurate predictions in the American context.

Ethical and Legal Concerns:
Explore any legal and ethical considerations related to using cab service APIs. Make sure to adhere to terms of use and privacy policies while scraping data from these sources.

Data Privacy and Security:
Address concerns about handling user data, especially if you're scraping APIs. Discuss how you plan to handle and secure the data to ensure user privacy.

Comparative Analysis:
Compare the differences between Uber and Ola, such as pricing strategies, service availability, and user preferences. This can add depth to your project by demonstrating your understanding of the competitive landscape.

Alternative Data Sources:
If APIs are not available, you could explore alternative data sources like open data repositories, ride-sharing datasets, or even simulate data to create a proof-of-concept model.

Performance Metrics in Different Markets:
Discuss how the performance metrics of your model might vary between India and the USA due to differences in travel patterns, pricing structures, and other factors.
